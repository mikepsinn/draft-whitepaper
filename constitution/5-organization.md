# üèõ Organization

üëà [Back to Table of Contents](../)

CureDAO is a laboratory consisting of many experiments.

It‚Äôs a global laboratory where the 7 billion human ‚Äúnatural experiments‚Äù revealing the effects of various factors on human health and happiness are conducted.

It‚Äôs an experiment to determine if a new model for clinical research using real-world data can more effectively reduce the global burden of chronic illness.

It‚Äôs an experiment to see if a new economic model called Collaborationism can reward the creation of open-source ‚Äúpublic goods‚Äù and overcome the failures of Capitalism and Communism.

It‚Äôs an experiment to determine if a direct democracy can produce better results than traditional hierarchical command and control organizations.

Given the unprecedented nature of such a project, each working group will be constantly experimenting with new ways to execute this mission. We recognize the importance of using real-world evidence in the mission of improving human health. Execution within the working groups should take the same data-driven approach to execute their area of the overall mission.

Accordingly, the organization is composed of three primary components

1. Citizen Scientists - DAO data donors or token holders with voting rights
2. DAO Laboratories - Working groups consisting of a Lab Manager who helps Lab Technicians carry out the duties of their Laboratory in accordance with the will of the Citizen Scientists.
3. External Service Providers - Individuals or entities outside the DAO deemed necessary to carry out the will of the Citizen Scientists.

### Citizen Scientists

As an open and permissionless organization, anyone has the right to earn their Citizenship through the contribution of labor or resources. In exchange, the Citizen Scientist will receive CureDAO tokens granting full governance rights over the actions of DAO Lab Staff.

Citizens may participate in:

1. Governance Debate on Discourse
2. Token-Based Voting by staking their Governance Tokens on smart contracts

### Lab Managers and Technicians

Lab Staff comprises the Laboratory working groups who carry out the will of the DAO. Citizens can apply to join Laboratories based on their experience or expertise. Laboratories may elect Lab Managers, who are responsible for coordinating between Laboratory Technicians. Laboratories may decide to create incentives for their Citizen Scientists in a variety of forms, including paying them for services or creating bounties.

In cases where Lab Staff are paid, Citizens may choose to compensate them with any of the following:

1. DAO Governance Tokens
2. Ethereum
3. Fiat Currency
4. Other Incentives

### Initial Laboratories

The initial Laboratories will be created to carry out the following primary functions:

* Governance Lab - Changes governance and how proposals are created and deployed. Handles technical aspects of DAO token creation and distribution. Develops the DAO‚Äôs smart contracts.
* Legal Lab - Handles legal matters regarding business structure, health data, liability issues, and business contracts.
* Coordination Lab - Handles operational matters such as human resources, compensation, project management, onboarding.  Provides resources for Lab Staff.
* Community Lab - Promotes community engagement with DAO and the broader world.
* UI/UX Lab - Creates a user-friendly interface for the platform front end.
* Collaborations - Facilitates financing of DAO projects. Coordinates partnerships between individuals and organizations.
* Dev Lab - Implements the platform back end and user interface
* Public Relations Lab - Promotes DAO‚Äôs presence in the public discourse.
* Data Lab - Integrates data from various sources and formats. Conducts research on data science and machine learning.

#### Service Providers

Service providers provide services to CureDAO, such as:

* development work
* IP sourcing and conversion to NFTs
* marketplace services
* public relations
* legal services
* data science
* customer support
* marketing

CureDAO will contract service providers and pay for their services with any of the following:

1. DAO Governance Tokens
2. Ethereum
