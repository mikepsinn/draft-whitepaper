  ecosystem, are created, distributed, and used.

# ðŸª™ Tokenomics

ðŸ‘ˆ [Back to Table of Contents](../)

The CureDAO token is the economic driver of the CureDAO platform. Tokens are obtained by contributing work, data, IP,
or funds to CureDAO. The core function of $dCURES is to incentivize data sharing and open-source collaboration.

dCURES tokens grant [Citizen Scientists](5-organization.md) the right to decide:

1. How data will be monetized
2. How the platform will be monetized
3. How contributors to the platform will be compensated
4. How the platform is architected
5. The terms on which strategic partnerships will be created
6. Which Gitcoin Grants or Bounties receive funds
7. What IP contributors will receive funds and how much
8. How internal [DAO Laboratories](5-organization.md) budgets and projects are funded
9. How CureDAO is governed
10. How the CureDAO treasury will be managed

## Token Genesis

30% of the total supply will go to the community during the initial genesis, and 70% remain unminted and available in CureDAOâ€™s treasury to ensure the sustainability of the platform. Members may elect to issue further tokens at any time to the public or select strategic entities and funders. Furthermore, CureDAO may allocate tokens to various incentive mechanisms as proposed herein or by the community.

### Token Supply and Distribution

#### Option 1: Token Supply in Proportion to Current Risk Allocation

Imagine the cause of the [2 billion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5876976/) people suffering from chronic diseases in the US was the result of an 
and an alien race conducting biological terrorism against earth. 
Now consider the fact that the US spends [$766 billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272473/us-military-spending-from-2000-to-2012) to address foreign threats to safety.  

[3,222](https://www.start.umd.edu/pubs/START_AmericanTerrorismDeaths_FactSheet_Nov2017.pdf) Americans have died from 
these threats since 1995, or 119 victims per year. 
Spending on this threat comes out to $6.4 billion per victim. 

Now imagine that clinical research spending was allocated in proportion to the number of deaths from chronic disease.
Insurance actuaries calculate the costs of insurance based up the likelihood of the threat which they're insuring against.

If we were to apply actuarial science and value the threat of disease as much as the threat of disease, that would 
come out to $853,726,256,983,240,000 (~$853 quadrillion).  

CureDAO values the suffering of all equally. Since we plan to serve as the model for a world that does the same,
we propose to mint 853,726,256,983,240,000 CureDAO tokens to be allocated by the will of the people.

##### Downsides
Harmony (ONE) has a maximum supply of 12.6 billion tokens. 853 quadrillion is a lot of tokens.

##### Upsides
The narrative and attention to the irrational allocation of societal resources. 
Psychological benefits of receiving a large amount of tokens.

#### Option 2: Token Supply to Simulate a Global Direct Democracy

Dollars are essentially votes on how society allocates it's resources.
The total global money supply is [$1.3 quadrillion](https://www.google.com/search?q=global+money+supply&rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS975US975&oq=global+money+suppl&aqs=chrome.0.0i512l3j69i57j0i512l6.3376j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).
CureDAO is an experiment in global direct democracy.  
Thus, we propose to mint 1.3 quadrillion CureDAO tokens to be allocated by the will of the people.

##### Downsides
- Harmony (ONE) has a maximum supply of 12.6 billion tokens. 85 quadrillion is a lot of tokens.
- The value of a token relative to the USD would initially be very small.  However, the CureDAO token will be 
  capped at $1.3 quadrillion.  The global money supply has no cap.

##### Upsides
- The ability to simulate a global direct democracy.
- Psychological benefits of receiving a large amount of tokens.

#### Option 3: Token Supply to Ensure One Token for Every Citizen Scientist on Earth

The goal of CureDAO is for every human on earth to share the natural experiments that define their existence. The worldâ€™s population is projected to peak at 9.4 billion around 2070. To enable everyone to become a [Citizen Scientist](5-organization.md), upon genesis, 9.4 billion CureDAO tokens will be created as ERC20 tokens controlled by CureDAO. CureDAOâ€™s token begins unable to exceed that number - it is a capped ERC20 token. Our core collective mission at This token supply may only increase if the world population exceeds 9.4 billion.

##### Downsides
- Harmony (ONE) has a maximum supply of 12.6 billion tokens. 85 quadrillion is a lot of tokens.
- The value of a token relative to the USD would initially be very small.  However, the CureDAO token will be
  capped at $1.3 quadrillion.  The global money supply has no cap.

##### Upsides
- The ability to simulate a global direct democracy.
- Psychological benefits of receiving a large amount of tokens.

The genesis distribution event will make 10% of CureDAOâ€™s total token supply available to interested participants using a fair and open smart contract auction on the Ethereum blockchain.

| Token Quantity | Fraction of Total | Recipient                 |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| 940M           | 10%               | Community Genesis         |
| 940M           | 10%               | Service Providers (Voted) |
| 940M           | 10%               | DAO Laboratories (Voted)  |
| 6.58B          | 70%               | Treasury                  |
| **9.4B**       | **100%**          | **Total**                 |

Since CureDAOâ€™s genesis operates via a public auction, the community decides the initial token price. We estimate a minimum of $5,000,000 will be required to support the first iteration of the platform.

CureDAO will be fully decentralized and community-owned from inception. No entity will own CureDAO tokens before the genesis contribution event.

dCUREâ€™s genesis contribution event will run via a fair launch public auction, granting all successful auction 
participants equal governance rights per CureDAO token. Once issued the first 10% of tokens, the CureDAO core community 
will begin voting on the first governance proposals to allocate additional tokens to DAO Laboratory working groups and service providers.

The approval of these allocations to [DAO Laboratories](5-organization.md), contributors, and service providers is at the full discretion of genesis [Citizen Scientists](5-organization.md) and their approval. They form the core of CureDAOâ€™s decision-making and executive body.
