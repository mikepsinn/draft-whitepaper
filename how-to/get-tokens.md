# ðŸª™ Quests and Tokens

CureDAO is built on the [Aragon](https://client.aragon.org/#/curedao1) DAO platform.  The unit of democratic power in CureDAO is the $CURE1 token on the Harmony blockchain. &#x20;

$CURE1 tokens give you control over CureDAO and how it allocates its resources.

$CURE1 tokens are awarded for the completion of quests and experiments that advance the CureDAO mission.  Quests and Experiments are outlined in GitHub Issues.  As a rule of thumb, an hour-long Quest is rewarded with 60 tokens.&#x20;
